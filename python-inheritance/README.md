## Resources

- Inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Inheritance in Python
- Learn to Program 10 : Inheritance Magic Methods

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions

### Requirements
#### Python Scripts
Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`<br>
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `python3 (version 3.8.)`<br>
All your files should end with a new line<br>
The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`<br>
A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository<br>
A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory<br>
Your code should use the `pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)`<br>
All your files must be executable<br>
The length of your files will be tested using `wc`<br>

#### Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`<br>
All your files should end with a new line <br>
All your test files should be inside a folder `tests` <br>
All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`) <br>
All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*` <br>
All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`) <br>
All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`) <br>
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified) <br>
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests! <br>
